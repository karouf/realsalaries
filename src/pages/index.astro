      <p class="mb-4 text-tropical-2">
        Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, eroding purchasing power. 
        Even with regular salary increases, if your wages don't grow at least as fast as inflation, you're actually 
        getting poorer in real terms.

      <div class="bg-tropical-3/20 p-4 rounded-md mb-6">
        <p class="font-medium text-tropical-1">Example: If inflation is 5% per year and your salary increases by only 2%, 
        your purchasing power has actually decreased by 3%.</p>
